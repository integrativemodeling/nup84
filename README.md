# Nup84 complex

These scripts demonstrate the use of [IMP](http://salilab.org/imp), [MODELLER](http://salilab.org/modeller), and [PMI](https://github.com/salilab/pmi) in the modeling of the Nup84 complex using DSS/EDC crosslinks and 2D EM data.

First, MODELLER is used to generate
structures for the individual components in the Nup84 complex. Then, IMP
is used to fit these components together into the electron microscopy density
map of Nup84 complex.

The script works with the latest IMP, PMI and isd_emxÂ¡l libraries.

Compile IMP using mpi (needed for the replica exchange, use "module load mpi/openmpi-x86_64-nodlopen" on the cluster)

## List of files and directories:

- data		                         contains all relevant data, input structure, etc.

- nup84.isd.modeling.withXrayInterface.py  the main modeling script with 3 crystal interfaces

- nup84.isd.modeling.py                    the main modeling script with no crystal interfaces

- nup84.topology.withXrayInterface.py      constructs Nup84 subunits with 3 crystal interfaces, as well as calculates the densities for the EM restraints

- nup84.topology.py                        constructs Nup84 subunits with no crystal interfaces, as well as calculates the densities for the EM restraints

- output.1/pdbs    the production will write the best scoring models into pdb files they are initialized and then updated as long as the calculation goes
                 (They are the best 500 models, so at the beginning they are empty, since you haven't start the calculation yet)

- output.1/rmfs    the production will write the rmf3 files for lowest temperature replica.
			
- stat.n.out	 log files. They contain all relevant numbers of the calculation.

Python dependencies:
- biopython 		(to read fasta files)
- sklearn   		(for the gaussian mixture model decomposition of the EM map)

## Biopython and sklearn are required to run nup84 script:
- sudo yum install python-biopython
- sudo yum install scikit-learn

## Getting IMP, PMI, ISD_EMXL and compiling it with fast-build on Fedora:
git clone https://github.com/salilab/imp.git imp-latest

cd imp-latest/modules
git clone https://github.com/salilab/isd_emxl.git

git clone https://github.com/salilab/pmi.git

cd ../

module load mpi

./setup_git.py

cd ..

mkdir imp-latest-build

cd imp-latest-build/

cmake ../imp-latest -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DIMP_MAX_CHECKS=NONE -DIMP_MAX_LOG=SILENT

make

## Running nup84 script:
with 3 crytal interfaces:
- imp-latest-build/setup_environment.sh /path_to/mpirun -np 4 python nup84.isd.modeling.withXrayInterface.py & > nup84.isd.modeling.withXrayInterface.out

with no crytal interfaces:
- imp-latest-build/setup_environment.sh /path_to/mpirun -np 4 python nup84.isd.modeling.py &> nup84.isd.modeling.out
